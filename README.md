This was my first year participating in Advent of Code. December is quite a busy month for me, so I didn’t have enough free time to complete more than nine and a half days. Still, it was fun to brush up on my long-forgotten Java knowledge.
Hopefully, next year I'll have more time and finish more challenges.

(Warning: The code for sure isn't pretty — I haven't written anything in Java for over 15 years.)
